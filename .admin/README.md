# Administrative Tools for the homework assignment

## fork

This script creates a new hw-repo for the inteview candidate based on the
template homework repo. It also adds the candidate's github user as a collaborator to the new repo.

It requires [gh](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation), GitHub's cli tool. Please follow the link on how to install `gh` before using our `fork` script.
